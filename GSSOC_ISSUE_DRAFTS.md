## Issue 7: [Plugin] Oh My Posh Theme Configurator (Python/JS)
**Labels**: `type:feature`, `GSSOC`, `level:intermediate`

**Description**:
Oh My Posh is a popular prompt theme engine for any shell. Its configuration is stored in a complex JSON/YAML file. We want a plugin to manage these themes declaratively.

**Tasks**:
- Create a new plugin in `plugins/oh-my-posh/`.
- Allow users to specify a theme name or a local theme file path in `config.yaml`.
- The plugin should download/copy the theme and update the user's PowerShell `$PROFILE` to initialize it.
- Ensure it handles path refreshes so the prompt works immediately.

## Issue 8: [Plugin] Microsoft PowerToys Configurator (Python/JS)
**Labels**: `type:feature`, `GSSOC`, `level:intermediate`

**Description**:
Microsoft PowerToys is a suite of utilities for power users (FancyZones, Awake, PowerRename, etc.). All settings are stored in JSON files within `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\PowerToys\`.

**Tasks**:
- Create a new plugin in `plugins/powertoys/`.
- Implement logic to manage general PowerToys settings and at least 3 specific modules (e.g., FancyZones, Awake, and PowerToys Run).
- The plugin should handle merging the desired state into the existing JSON files and notify PowerToys to reload configurations if necessary.

## Issue 9: [Plugin] Community Choice: Config Manager for any Windows App (Python/JS)
**Labels**: `type:feature`, `GSSOC`, `level:intermediate`

**Description**:
Windows is full of applications that store configuration in various places (AppData, Registry, JSON files, etc.). We want you to build a plugin for an application of your choice that makes its configuration declarative.

**Tasks**:
- Choose a common Windows application (e.g., Discord, Steam, Spotify, Obsidian, etc.) that has a complex or hidden configuration.
- Identify where it stores its settings (e.g., `%APPDATA%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, or Registry).
- Create a new plugin in `plugins/<app-name>/`.
- Implement logic to manage these settings via WinHome's `config.yaml`.
- Ensure the plugin is idempotent (doesn't overwrite changes if the state is already correct).
